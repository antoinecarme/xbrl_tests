Summary of significant accounting\npolicies\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been pre-\npared in compliance with \u2018International Financial Reporting Standards\n(IFRS)\u2019, as adopted for use in the European Union as of the balance\nsheet date.\nThe amounts in the financial statements are presented in thousands of\neuro unless stated otherwise. The financial statements were prepared\nin accordance with the historical cost principle, except for valuation at\nfair value of derivative financial instruments.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nthat management make certain estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying\nnotes.\nEstimates made on each reporting date reflect the conditions that\nexisted on those dates (e.g. market prices, interest rates and foreign\nexchange rates). Although these estimates are based on management\u2019s\nbest knowledge of current events and actions that the Group may under-\ntake, actual results may differ from those estimates.\nThe most important application of estimates relates to:\nImpairment of intangible fixed assets with indefinite useful\nlife (including goodwill)\nIntangible fixed assets with indefinite useful life including goodwill are\nsubject to an annual impairment test. This test requires an estimation\nof the value-in-use of these assets. The estimate of the value-in-use\nrequires an estimate of the expected future cash flows related to these\nassets and the choice of an appropriate discount rate to determine\nthe present value of these cash flows. For the estimate of the future\ncash flows, management must make a number of assumptions and\nestimates, such as expectations with regard to growth in revenues,\ndevelopment of profit margin and operating costs, period and amount\nof investments, development of working capital, growth percentages for\nthe long term and the choice of a discount rate that takes into account\nthe specific risks. More details are given in note 3.\nEmployee benefits \u2013 share-based payments\nThe Group values the costs of the share option programmes on the basis\nof the fair value of the instruments on the grant date. The estimate of the\nfair value of the share-based payments requires a valuation depending on\nthe terms and conditions of the grant. The valuation model also requires\ninput data, such as the expected life of the option, the volatility and the\ndividend yield. The assumptions and the model used to estimate the fair\nvalue for share-based payments are explained in note 22.\nEmployee benefits \u2013 pensions\nThe costs of the defined pension plans and other long-term employee\nbenefits and the cash value of the pension liability are determined by\nactuarial calculations. To this end, various assumptions are used that\ncould differ from the actual developments in the future. As a conse-\nquence of the complexity of the actuarial calculations and the long-term\ncharacter of the liabilities, the employee liabilities are highly sensitive to\nchanges in the assumptions. The main actuarial assumptions and the\nsensitivity analysis are included in note 15.\nChange in accounting policies\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previ-\nous fiscal year except for the following new or revised IFRS standards\nand IFRIC interpretations effective as of 1\ue61fJanuary 2021:\n \u2013\nAmendments to IFRS 4\ue61fInsurance Contracts \u2013 deferral of IFRS 9,\neffective 1\ue61fJanuary 2021\n \u2013\nAmendments to IFRS 9\ue61fFinancial Instruments, IFRS 7\ue61fFinancial\nInstruments: Disclosures, IAS 39\ue61fFinancial Instruments: Recognition\nand measurement, IFRS 4\ue61fInsurance contracts and IFRS 16\ue61fLeases \u2013\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform \u2013 Phase 2, effective 1\ue61fJanuary 2021\n \u2013\nAmendments to IFRS 16\ue61fLeases \u2013 Covid-19\ue61frelated rent concessions\nbeyond 30\ue61fJune 2021, effective 1\ue61fApril 2021\n \nThe above changes did not have any material impact on the annual con-\nsolidated accounts of the Group, with exception for IFRS 16 Leases. A\nrent discount was received in 2021 of 596 thousand euro.\n\nConsolidation principles\nSubsidiaries\nVan de Velde NV has direct or indirect control over an entity if and only\nif it has all the following:\n \u2013 Power over the investee;\n \u2013\nExposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with\nthe investee; and\n \u2013 The ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount \nof the investor\u2019s returns.\n \nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated\nfinancial statements of the Group from the date that control commences\nuntil the date that control ceases. They are prepared as of the same\nreporting date and using the Group accounting policies. Intragroup bal-\nances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.\nAssociated companies\nAssociated companies are companies in which Van de Velde NV directly\nor indirectly has a significant influence. This is assumed to be the case\nwhen the Group holds at least 20% of the voting rights attached to\nthe shares. The financial statements of these companies are prepared\nin accordance with the same accounting policies used for the Group.\nThe consolidated financial statements contain the share of the Group\nin the result of associated companies in accordance with the equity\nmethod from the day that the significant influence is acquired until the\nday it ends. If the share of the Group in the losses of the associated\ncompanies is greater than the carrying amount of the participation, the\ncarrying amount is set at zero and additional losses are recognized only\ninsofar as the Group has assumed additional obligations.\nParticipations in associated companies are revalued if there are indica-\ntions of possible impairment or of the disappearance of the reasons for\nearlier impairments.\nThe participations valued in the balance sheet in accordance with the\nequity method also include the carrying amount of related goodwill.\nForeign currencies\nForeign currency transactions\nThe reporting currency of the Group is the euro. Foreign currency\ntransactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the transaction date.\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are\nconverted at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Gains and\nlosses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions\nand from the conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated\nin foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement. Non-\nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are\nconverted at the foreign exchange rate on the date of the transaction.\nFinancial statements of foreign activities\nVan de Velde\u2019s foreign operations outside the euro zone are considered\nto be foreign activities. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are converted to\neuro at foreign exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Income state-\nments of foreign entities are converted to euro at the average exchange\nrates of that currency over the past 12\ue61fmonths. The components of share-\nholders\u2019 equity are converted at historical rates. Exchange differences\narising from the conversion of shareholders\u2019 equity to euro at year-end\nexchange rates are recorded in \u2018Other comprehensive income\u2019. On sale\nor disposal of a foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recog-\nnized in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognized\nin the income statement.\nThe Group treats goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite use-\nful life, arising from business combinations, as a monetary item. As a\nresult, these assets are converted based on the exchange rate in effect\non the balance sheet date.\nIntangible assets\n(1) Research and development\nThe nature of the development costs within the Van de Velde Group,\nprimarily product and process innovation, is such that they do not meet\nthe criteria set out in IAS 38\ue61ffor recognition as intangible assets. They are\ntherefore expensed when incurred. Development costs within the Group\nin relation to research and development of software are capitalized under\nsoftware. The depreciation begins when the intangible assets are avail-\nable for use, and this by a straight-line depreciation over a period of five\nyears. When the activation starts, the conditions of IAS38 are fulfilled.\n(2) Acquired brands\nBrands acquired as part of business combinations are deemed to be\nintangible assets with an indefinite useful life. These are measured at the\nvalue established as part of the allocation of fair value of the identifiable\nassets, obligations and contingent obligations on the acquisition date,\nless accumulated impairment losses. These brands are not amortized\nbut are tested annually for impairment (for more details, see note 3).\nThe correctness of classification as intangible assets with indefinite\nuseful life is also evaluated.\n(3) Other intangible assets\nOther intangible assets (software and online platform) acquired by Van\nde Velde are recognized at cost (purchase price plus all directly attribut-\nable costs) less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment\nlosses. Expenses for the registration of trade names and designs are\nrecorded as brands with finite useful life to the extent that this relates to\nnew registrations in the country of registration. Other expenditures on\ninternally generated goodwill and brands are recognized in the income\nstatement when incurred. Amortization begins when the intangible asset\nis available using the straight-line method. The useful life of intangible\nassets with a finite life is generally estimated at three to five years. Other\nintangible assets include acquired distribution rights and similar rights,\nwhich are amortized over a period of five years. The rules of IAS 38\ue61fare\nmet at the moment of activation of other intangible assets.\n\nGoodwill\n(1) Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the\nfair value of the Group\u2019s share of the net identifiable assets of the\nacquired subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is\ntested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Goodwill\nis treated by the Group as an asset of the parent and is considered as\na monetary item. As a result, these assets are converted based on the\nrate in force at the balance sheet date. Goodwill is recorded at cost less\naccumulated impairment losses.\n(2) Negative goodwill\nIf the Group\u2019s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets,\nliabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business\ncombination, Van de Velde will immediately recognize any positive dif-\nference through profit or loss.\nTangible fixed assets\n(1) Initial expenditure\nTangible fixed assets are recognized at cost less accumulated deprecia-\ntion and accumulated impairment losses. Cost is determined as being\nthe purchase price plus other directly attributable acquisition costs, such\nas non-refundable tax and transport.\n(2) Subsequent expenditure\nSubsequent expenditures are capitalized only when it increases the\nfuture economic benefits embodied in the item of property, plant and\nequipment. Otherwise, it is recognized in profit or loss when incurred.\n(3) Depreciation\nThe depreciable amount equals the cost of the asset less its residual\nvalue. Depreciation starts from the date the asset is ready for use, using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.\nResidual value and useful life are reviewed at least at each fiscal year end.\nThe depreciation rates used are as follows:\nBuildings 15-25\ue61fyears\nProduction machinery and equipment  2-10\ue61fyears\nElectronic office equipment\n(1)\n 3-5\ue61fyears\nFurniture\n(1)\n 5-10\ue61fyears\nVehicles 3-5\ue61fyears\n \nLand is not depreciated as it is deemed to have an indefinite life.\nImpairment of assets\nThe carrying amount of Van de Velde\u2019s fixed assets, other than deferred\ntax assets, financial assets and other non-current assets are reviewed\non each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indica-\ntion of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset\u2019s recover-\nable amount is estimated. An impairment test is conducted annually\non intangible assets that are not yet available for use, intangible assets\nwith an indefinite useful life and goodwill, regardless of whether there\nis any indication of impairment. An impairment loss is recognized in\nprofit or loss whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its\nrecoverable amount.\n(1) Calculation of recoverable amount\nThe realizable value of an asset is the greater of its fair value less cost\nto sell and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future\ncash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money\nand the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate\nlargely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined\nfor the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n(2) Reversal of impairment\nImpairment losses on goodwill and intangible fixed assets with indefi-\nnite useful life are not reversed. For any other assets, an impairment\nloss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to \ndetermine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only\nto the extent that the asset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the car-\nrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or\namortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\nInvestments in associates\nIn 2021, Van de Velde changed the method of converting the share in the\nnet asset of Top Form International Ltd. to bring it in line with the require\n-\nment of IAS 21 39 a and c. whereby the underlying share in the net asset\nof Top Form International Ltd. is converted at the closing rate, and the\nconversion differences are included in other comprehensive income.\nTo keep the figures comparable, this IAS 8 restatement has been made\nin the opening balance sheet as of 1 January 2020, as well as in the other\ncomprehensive income for the 12-month period ended 31 December\n2020. This restatement has no impact on the profit and loss account\nof this period or for the comparable periods but is recognized in other\ncomprehensive income.\nParticipation in associates  \n(in 000 euro)\n01.01.2020\n31.12.2020\nBook value before adjustment 11,631  10,505\nImpact change in calculation of conversion\nassociated company\n3,117  2,025\nBook value after adjustment 14,748 12,525\nEquity - Other comprehensive income\n(in 000 euro)\n01.01.2020\n31.12.2020\nBook value before adjustment -6,312 -7,518\nImpact change in calculation of conversion\nassociated company\n3,117  2,025\nBookvalue after adjustment  -3,195  -5,493\nInventories\nRaw materials, work in progress, merchandise and finished goods are\nvalued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost of inventories\ncomprises all purchase costs, conversion costs and other costs incurred\nin bringing the inventories to their present location and present condition.\nThe valuation method for the stocks is the first in first out (FIFO) method.\nPurchasing costs include:\n \u2013 Purchase price, plus\n \u2013 Import duties and other taxes (if not recoverable), plus\n \u2013\nTransport, handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisi-\ntion of the goods, less\n \u2013 Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items.\n \nConversion costs include:\n \u2013 Costs directly related to the units of production, plus\n \u2013\nA systematic allocation of fixed and variable indirect production costs.\n \nThe provision for obsolescence is calculated consistently throughout the\nGroup based on the age and expected future sales of the items at hand.\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade receivables are recognized at cost less impairment losses. If there\nis objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on trade\nreceivables, the impairment loss recognized is the difference between\nthe carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash\nflows. All trade receivables are individually assessed for excess impair-\nment according to the ECL model.\n(a) Classification and valuation\nUnder IFRS 9, debt instruments are subsequently valued at fair value\nthrough profit or loss (FVTPL), amortized cost or fair value with recogni-\ntion of value adjustments to unrealized results (FVTOCI). The classifica-\ntion is based on two criteria: the business model of the Group for the\nmanagement of the assets; and whether the contractual cash flows\nof the instruments represent \u2018principal and interest payments only\u2019 on\nthe outstanding principal. Trade receivables and other financial assets\nare held to collect contractual cash flows and lead to cash flows that\nrepresent only payments of principal and interest. These are classified\nand valued as debt instruments at amortized cost as explained in the\n\u2018Revenue from contracts with customers\u2019 section.\nThe Group has not designated financial obligations as FVTPL. There are\nno changes in the classification and valuation of the Group\u2019s financial\nliabilities.\n(b) Impairment\nIFRS 9\ue61frequires the Group to recognize a provision for expected credit\nlosses (ECLs) for all debt instruments that are not held at fair value\nthrough profit or loss and contract assets. ECLs are based on the differ-\nence between the contractual cash flow that follows from the contract\nand all cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted on\nthe basis of the effective interest rate. For trade receivables, the Group\nuses the simplified application for the calculation of the ECLs whereby\nan impairment is recognized on the basis of historical credit losses,\nadjusted for economic or credit conditions that are such that the actual\nlosses are greater or less than suggested by historical trends.\nLeases\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or con\n-\ntains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use\nof an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nGroup as a lessee\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for\nall leases, except for short-term leases (<12\ue61fmonths) and leases of\nlow-value assets (<\u20ac 5,000). The Group recognizes lease liabilities to\nmake lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to\nuse the underlying assets.\ni)  Right-of-use assets\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of\nthe lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-\nof-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation\nand impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease\nliabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets is valued at the initial value of\nthe obligation. The cost increases with the lease payments on or before\nthe start of the lease, decreases with the lease benefits, increases with\nthe initial direct costs of the lessee and increases with the estimate of\nthe costs for restoring the asset to its original condition. Right-of-use\nassets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the\nlease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\n\u2022  Plant and machinery  maximum 10\ue61fyears\n\u2022  Motor vehicles     maximum 5\ue61fyears\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of\nthe lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option,\ndepreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the\naccounting policies in section(s) Impairment of non-financial assets.\nii)  Lease liabilities\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease\nliabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made\nover the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less\nany lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend\non an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual\nvalue guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of\na purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and\npayments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects\nthe Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments\nthat do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in\nthe period in which the event that triggers the payment occurs.\nTo determine the current value of the lease payments, the group will\ndiscount future lease payments at the incremental interest rate on the\nstart date (i.e. the interest that the lessee would pay if he took out a loan\nwith the bank for a similar asset over a similar duration). After the com-\nmencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect\nthe accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In\naddition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there\nis a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease pay-\nments (e.g. changes to future payments resulting from a change in an\nindex or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the\nassessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\niii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its\nshort-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that\nhave a lease term of 12\ue61fmonths or less from the commencement date\nand do not contain a purchase option). The Group also applies the exemp-\ntion for leases for which the underlying assets have a low value (value\nbelow \u20ac 5,000).\nDerivative financial instruments\nHedges\nVan de Velde applies derivative financial instruments only in order to\nreduce the exposure to foreign currency risk. These financial instru-\nments are entered into in accordance with the aims and principles laid\ndown by general management, which prohibits the use of such financial\ninstruments for speculation purposes.\nDerivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value.\nAlthough they provide effective economic hedges, they do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting under the specific requirements in IAS 39\ue61f(Financial\nInstruments: Recognition and Measurement). As a result, at reporting\ndate all derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecognized immediately in the income statement. The fair value of deriva-\ntives is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at the\nprevailing interest rates. All spot purchases and sales of financial assets\nare recognized on the settlement date.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include bank balances, available cash and\nshort-term deposits. Interest income is recognized based on the effec-\ntive interest rate of the asset.\nShare capital\n(1) Change in capital\nWhen there is an increase or decrease in Van de Velde\u2019s share capital,\nall directly attributable costs relating to that event are deducted from\nequity and not recognized in profit or loss when incurred.\n(2) Dividends\nDividends are recognized as a liability in the period in which they are\napproved by the General Meeting.\nProvisions\nProvisions are recognized when Van de Velde has a present legal or\nconstructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable\nthat an outflow will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable\nestimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect is\nmaterial, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future\ncash flows at a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time\nvalue of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\nEmployee benefits\n(1) Pension plan\nVan de Velde has group insurance plans for its Belgian employees and\ngroup insurance plans for its employees elsewhere. Under IAS 19\ue61fall\npension plans are recognized as defined contribution plans or defined\npension plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan in which a\ncompany pays fixed contributions to a separate company and has no\nlegal or actual obligation to pay further contributions if the pension fund\nhas inadequate assets to pay the benefits related to the years of service\nin the current or previous periods to all employees. A defined pension\nplan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.\nThe pension plans in foreign countries are defined contribution plans. The\ncosts connected with these are recognized through profit and loss when\nincurred. Retirement plans in Belgium are defined retirement plans.\n\nA liability was recognized in the balance sheet with regard to the Belgian\npension schemes equal to the sum of the cash value of the gross liabili-\nties on account of defined pension entitlements (including the tax due\non contributions relating to pension costs) as at the balance sheet date,\nless the market value of the fund investments. An independent actuary\nmakes on an annual basis an actuarial calculation of this gross liability\nusing the projected unit credit method.\nThe interest expense is calculated by applying a discount rate to the\nasset or the liability of the defined pension entitlements. This inter-\nest expense is recognized through profit and loss. In establishing an\nappropriate discount rate, the company bases itself on the interest rates\napplicable to high-grade corporate bonds in cash, which correspond to\nthe currency in which the liability is expected to be paid in accordance\nwith the expected duration of the defined pension liability.\nRevaluations, including actuarial gains and losses and the return on fund\ninvestments (excluding net interest expense), are recognized in other\ncomprehensive income when they occur. Revaluations must not be\nreclassified to profit and loss in later periods.\nPast service pension cost is recognized through profit and loss when the\nplan is changed or when the related restructuring or termination benefits\nbecome payable by the company, whichever occurs first.\n(2) Share-based payments\nThe fair value of the share options awarded under the Group\u2019s share\noption plan is established on the grant date, with due consideration\nfor the terms and conditions under which the options are granted and\nusing a valuation technique corresponding to generally accepted valu-\nation methods for establishing the price of financial instruments and\nwith due consideration for all relevant factors and assumptions. The\nfair value of the share options is recognized as personnel expenses for\nthe period until the beneficiary acquires the option unconditionally (i.e.\nvesting date). This concerns equity settled option plans being incorpo-\nrated in the equity.\nIncome tax\nIncome tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and\ndeferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the income statement except\ninsofar as it relates to items included in shareholders\u2019 equity. In that\ncase, income tax is included in shareholders\u2019 equity.\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the\nyear, using applicable tax rates on the balance sheet date, and any\nadjustments to tax payables with respect to previous years.\nFor financial reporting purposes, deferred income tax is calculated using\nthe liability method based on temporary differences at the balance sheet\ndate between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying\namounts.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognized only insofar as it is probable\nthat taxable profit will be available against which the deductible tem-\nporary differences, the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused\ntax losses can be utilized.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates\nthat are expected to apply in the year in which the asset is realized or\nthe liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been\nimplemented or substantively implemented at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when a legally\nenforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax\nliabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and\nthe same taxation authority.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are stated at cost, Trade payables are non-\ninterest bearing and are normally settled on 30-day terms. Other paya-\nbles are non-interest bearing and have an average term of six months.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nIFRS 15\ue61fprovides a five-step model for the administrative processing\nof revenue from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is\nrecognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the\nentity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n(1) Goods sold\nThe two biggest revenue streams of the Group are revenue from whole-\nsale and revenue from retail. Within these revenue streams, it is usually\nexpected that the sale of the goods represents the only performance\nobligation. Furthermore, the revenue is recognized when the control\nover the article is transferred to the customer, usually upon delivery\nof the goods.\nAllowed discounts for cash payments are charged to the profit and loss\naccount at the moment of the collection of the claim. This discount is\nincluded as a reduction in turnover. Van de Velde has applied the practical\nexpedient for allowed discounts for cash payments. That is, the promised\namount of consideration is not adjusted for the effects of a significant\nfinancing component if the period between the transfer of the promised\ngood or service and the payment is one year or less.\nSales of products in the physical and digital stores are recorded when\nthe sale is settled. The sale is recorded in revenue excluding taxes on\nsales and value added taxes and includes discounts and commercial\npromotions.\nThe necessary provisions for returns are recognized and revised every\nsix months based on historical data.\n(2) Gift cards and store credits\nThe Group\u2019s retail network sells gift cards and issues credits to its cus-\ntomers when merchandise is returned. The cards and credits either do\nnot expire or have an expiry date of up to 24\ue61fmonths. In line with IFRS 15,\nthe Group recognizes sales from gift cards when they are redeemed by\nthe customer. The unused gift cards and credits are included in the profit\nand loss account in accordance with internally determined percentages.\nThis recognition represents the estimate of the management of which\nthe probability of use by the customer is estimated to be minimal. This\nprofit is included in turnover.\nFinancial income\nFinancial income comprises dividend income and interest income.\nRoyalties arising from the use by others of the company\u2019s resources\nare recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits associated\n\nwith the transaction will flow to the company and the revenue can be\nmeasured reliably. Dividend income is recognized in the income state-\nment on the date that the dividend is. Interest income is recognized\nbased on the effective interest rate of the asset.\nGovernment grants\nA government grant is recognized when there is reasonable assur-\nance that it will be received and that the company will comply with the\nattached conditions.

In 2012 an impairment charge of 5,531 thousand euro was recognized on this brand.\n \u2013 The Intimacy brand and concept acquired in 2010. This brand and concept is fully written off in 2014 (7,784 thousand euro).\n \u2013 The Rigby & Peller brand and concept acquired in 2011, the fair value of which was determined as part of a business combination.\n \u2013 These brands are considered to have an indefinite useful life because the Group sees them as a fully fledged extension of its existing brand \nportfolio.\nImpairment test\nIn the fourth quarter of every year, the Group conducts its annual impairment test for each cash-generating unit. The following intangible assets\nallocated to each of the cash-generating units were subject to an impairment test in 2021:\n000\ue61feuro Andres Sarda Intimacy Rigby & Peller Re-tail Total\nGoodwill 0 0 1,820 2,797 4,617\nBrands with indefinite useful life 5,469 0 7,014 0 12,483\nTotal intangible assets 5,469 0 8,834 2,797 17,100\nResult of the impairment test\nIn 2021\ue61fthe impairment test showed that the realizable value for all cash-\ngenerating units (Andres Sarda, Rigby & Peller and Re-tail) exceeded the\ncarrying value and hence no impairment was required.\nMethodology applied to the impairment test\nThis test aims to compare the realizable value and the carrying value of\neach cash-generating unit:\n \u2013 A model-based approach determines the realizable value based on \nthe calculated value-in-use, being the present value of the future\nexpected cash flows from these cash-generating units:\n \u2013\nFor the first two years in the forecast period (2022-2023), the\ngrowth plan as approved by the Board of Directors is used as\nthe basis.\n \u2013 For the subsequent years (2024-2025), a cash flow projection is \ndrawn up based on realistic assumptions.\n \u2013 The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future \nexpected cash flows is based on the market assessments and is\nexplained below.\n \nThe calculation of the value-in-use for all cash-generating units is most\nsensitive to the following assumptions:\n \u2013 Turnover assumptions for the forecast period;\n \u2013 EBITDA\n(1)\n development and EBITDA margins applied to the turnover\nforecast;\n \u2013\nGrowth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the forecast\nperiod;\n \u2013 Discount rate.\n(1)   Operating pro\ufb01t before depreciation and amortization\nThe assumptions related to turnover and EBITDA developments are\nbased on available internal data as well as historical percentages on the\nbasis of experience, which are determined for each of the cash-gener-\nating units separately. The growth rate and discount rates are checked\nagainst external sources insofar as possible and relevant.\nTurnover assumptions for the forecast period\nFor the three cash-generating units, the growth plan as approved by\nthe Board of Directors is the starting point for the first two years in the\nforecast period (2022-2023).\nFor Andres Sarda we expect turnover growth during the period \n2024-2025.\nFor the planning period (2022-2025) moderate turnover growth on a\nlike-for-like basis has been applied to the cash-generating units Rigby\n& Peller and Re-tail.\nFully aligned with the segment reporting, the turnover estimates for the\ncash-generating units Rigby & Peller and Re-tail include the retail turnover\nrealized by the stores as well as the wholesale turnover for the Van de\nVelde products sold by these retail channels. Futhermore, the estimate\nfor Rigby & Peller also takes into account the digital sales generated\noutside the United Kingdom under the Rigby & Peller brand name.\nEBITDA development and EBITDA margins applied to the\nturnover forecast\nA development towards the target EBITDA margin is assumed for Andres\nSarda. The improved margin for Andres Sarda should mainly be achieved\nthrough turnover growth in the wholesale business and continued pen-\netration of Andres Sarda in Van de Velde\u2019s own stores. The cost develop-\nments will also be monitored very strictly.\n\nA gradual increase in the EBITDA percentage towards the target EBITDA\npercentage for a (partially) integrated retail chain is assumed for the\ncash-generating units Rigby & Peller and Re-tail. This is achieved by\nmeans of a high gross margin, limited cost increases and the target\nmarket share of Van de Velde products. The contributions to EBITDA of\ndigital sales under the Rigby & Peller brand in Germany and the United\nStates of America were also included in the valuation.\nGrowth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the\nforecast period\nThe long-term percentage applied to extrapolate cash flows beyond the\nforecast period is assessed in line with the expected long-term inflation\nfor all cash-generating units (2%).\nDiscount rate\nThe discount rates represent the current market assessment of the\nrisks specific to the Van de Velde Group on the one hand and the cash-\ngenerating units on the other. The discount rates are estimated on the\nbasis of the weighted average cost of capital after tax and are for the\nthree cash-generating units in a range between 7.4% and 8.6%. This\ncorresponds to a cost of capital before tax of between 9.5% and 10.6%.\nSensitivity to changes in assumptions\nWith regard to the assessment of the value of the cash-generating unit\nAndres Sarda, Rigby & Peller and Re-tail, management is of the opinion,\nbased on the sensitivity analysis, that a change to the basic assumptions\nwould not currently lead to the book value of the unit exceeding the \nrealizable value. The tested sensitivities related to the following aspects:\n \u2013\nLower than planned turnover growth (of -4% or -5%) during the\nplanning period (2022-2025);\n \u2013 A reduction in the long-term percentage (from 2% to 1%) used to \nextrapolate the expected turnover;\n \u2013 An increase in the weighted average cost of capital of 7% or 8% to \n12% on average.\n",

This was intensified in the fiscal year ending\non 30 June 2020 by consequences of covid-19, as the majority of Top\nForms customers were forced to close stores worldwide.\nThese events had an impact on the share price, together with a very low\nshare trade volume and significant fluctuations in the share price due to\nthe limited number of transactions. In the past calendar year there were\noften several consecutive days without any trading in the share, and a\nsignificant part of the transactions in the past calendar year were linked\nto 1 person who increased his stake for 5% to 8.98%.\nTop Form moved back into profit in the fiscal year ending 31 December\n2021 and the transformation and related investment plans were con-\ntinued.  Based on all input available when the year was closed, Van de\nVelde continues to feel that the share in the underlying equity continues\nto reflect the value of the participation in Top Form most accurately. At\nthe closing of the year, the methodology was updated for identifying\nan impairment on Top Form\nImpairment test\nIn parallel with the impairment test on goodwill and brand names with\nindefinite useful life, a test was also performed on the value of the\nparticipation in Top Form.ests\nMethodology for impairment tests\nThis test consists in comparing the value according to the equity method\nas included in het balance sheet of Van de Velde share (25.66%) in the\nunderlying recoverable amount of Top Form, whereby the recoverable\namount is determined on the basis of the present value of the future\nexpected cash flows from the activities of Top Form.\nFor this test, budget and business plans prepared by Top Forms man-\nagement for the years 2022-2025, as also approved by Top Forms board\nof directors and audit committee, were used. These budgets include\nplanned investments and changes in working capital.\nIn order to check the reliability of the estimated cash flows, the budget\nexercise made for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 was compared with\nthe actual results. This exercise showed that Top Form is able to estimate\ntheir results in a reliable way. In accordance with the requirements of\nIFRS, confirmation was also received that these budgets have been pre-\npared in accordance with the current financial and operational structure\nof the group, without taking into account any future reorganisation or\nimprovements or adjustments of the asset.\nThe main assumptions used in the calculation, which are also most \nsensitive in determining the recoverable amount are:\n \u2013 A discounting rate of 11% was used for this test.\n \u2013 Turnover estimates used a growth between 5 to 7%\n \u2013\nGrowth percentage used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the plan-\nning period was set at 2.5%.  \n \nThe headroom in the base case scenario is 6,045 keur. The abovemen-\ntioned sensitivities were subjected to various sensitivity tests. The fol-\nlowing changes were made to the calculation models.\n \u2013\nTurnover estimates used during the period to which the expectations \nrelate were reduced to 3% and 5%. The headroom amounts in the\ncase 1,183 keur.  \n \u2013\nGrowth percentage used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the plan-\nning period was reduced to 1%. The headroom amounts 3,864 keur\nin this case.\n \u2013\nDiscounting rate was increased to 13%. The headroom is 2,628 keur\nin this case.\n \nThe sensitivity tests described above show that there is sufficient head-\nroom. As a result, the recoverable amount of Van de Velde\u2019s participation\nin Top Form, based on the calculations and tests, is higher than the car-\nrying amount included in the closing balance sheet of 2021.\nBased on the various valuation models used, there is currently no need\nto recognize an impairment on the financial assets as included on the\nbalance sheet of Van de Velde NV.\nThe abovementioned test is conducted annually to check for indications\nof an impairment on the asset, or more frequently if additional indicators\nof impairment should emerge.\n",

These plans are\nclarified on a cumulative basis, as they are situated in the same geo-\ngraphical location and have the same attributes and risk characteristics,\ni.e. defined retirement plans.\nAs well as the Belgian pension plans, the company also has pension\nplans for its staff in foreign countries. These pension plans are defined\ncontribution plans. In 2021 the pension provision on the balance sheet\nwas -24 thousand euro (24 thousand euro in 2020).\nThe pension plan in Belgium is subject to Belgian legislation and is a\ngroup insurance plan with guaranteed return (Tak 21). Since 2016, an\nannual actuarial valuation occurred on 31 December by an independ-\nent actuary.\nThe pension plan in Belgium is financed. If the fund investments are\nlower than the minimum guarantee set by law, the insurer will notify the\nemployer. The latter can then pay an additional contribution into the plan.\n\nThe adjusted actuarial calculation on 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 shows the following results:\nAt\n01/01/2020\nPension cost allocated to\nrealized income\nReturn\n(1)\nGain/(loss) as a consequence\nof changes to calculation\nmethod allocated to other\ncomprehensive income\n(2)\nEmployer contribution\nBenefits paid\nAt\n31/12/2020\nDefined pension entitlement liability -10,580 -890 -102 -1,440 0 705 -12,307\nMarket value of the fund investments 8,994 0 90 997 706 -705 10,082\nNet liability in the balance sheet -1,586 -890 -12 -443 706 0 -2,225\nAt\n01/01/2021\nPension cost allocated to\nrealized income\nReturn\n(1)\nGain/(loss) as a consequence of\nchanges to calculation method\nallocated to other comprehen-\nsive income\n(2)\nEmployer contribution\nBenefits paid\nAt\n31/12/2021\nDefined pension entitlement liability -12,307 -976 -55 2,037 -26 245 -11,082\nMarket value of the fund investments 10,082 0 47 -772 734 -245 9,846\nNet liability in the balance sheet -2,225 -976 -8 1,265 708 0 -1,236\n(1)  The \u2018Return\u2019 column includes the interest cost to the de\ufb01ned pension rights and the expected return on the asset.  \n(2)   For the 2021 \ufb01nancial year, 185 thousand euro of the change in calculation method allocated to other comprehensive income consists of experience adjustments, 951 thousand euro\n\ufb01nancial adjustments and 901 thousand euro demographic adjustments.

Changes in the assumptions impact\nthe carrying value of the pension liabilities.\nVan de Velde determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of\neach year. This is the interest rate that must be applied to determine\nthe cash value of the estimated future cash flows required to meet the\npension liabilities. When determining the appropriate discount rate, Van\nde Velde uses the interest rate of high-value corporate bonds expressed\nin the currency in which the pensions will be paid out and with a dura-\ntion com-parable to the duration of the corresponding pension liabilities.\nOther important assumptions for pension liabilities, such as the expected\nannual growth rate of salaries and expected withdrawals, are based\npartly on current market conditions and partly on proprietary parameters.\nThe investments primarily relate to qualifying insurance policies (99.9%\nof all investments). The expected contribution by the employer for the\nyear ending 31 December 2021 is 708 thousand euro.\nThe main actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the pension\nplans are shown in the table below:\n2021 2020\nAnnual pay rises (excluding inflation) 1.93%\nage 20-24: 6.60%\nage 25-29: 5.10%\nage 30-34: 2.60%\nage 35-39: 2.10%\nage 40-44: 3.10%\nfrom age 45: 1.60%\nAnnual inflation 1.90% 1.90%\nAnnual discount rate 1.00% 0.45%\nPension age in years 65 65\nTotal number of members 985 991\nAverage age in years 44.4 43.98\nEstimated duration in years 17.79 17.73\nThe table below shows the effect of the discount rate on the defined pension entitlement liability:\nValuation trend -0,5% Original Valuation trend -0,5%\nDiscount rate 0.50% 1.00% 1.50%\nDefined pension entitlement liability 12,040 11,082 10,217\nMarket value of the investment funds 10,663 9,846  9,104\nThe table below shows the effect of the withdrawals from the plan on the defined pension entitlement liability:\nOriginal Sensitivity\nWithdrawals from the plan Employer table 0.00%\nDefined pension entitlement 11,082 12,886\nThe sensitivity analysis in the above tables is determined on the basis of a method that shows the impact on the liability due to the defined pension\nentitlements as a consequence of reasonable changes to significant assumptions occurring at the end of the period. This analysis is based on a\nchange to a significant assumption that keeps all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of actual changes\nin the defined pension entitlement liability because it is unlikely that changes to the assumptions could occur in isolation.\n",

Van de Velde distinguishes two operating segments:\nWholesale and Retail. No segments have been combined.\nVan de Velde Group has identified the Management Committee as having\nprimary responsibility for operating decisions and has defined operat-\ning segments on the basis of information provided to the Management\nCommittee.\nWholesale refers to business with independent specialty retailers (cus-\ntomers external to the Group) and eCommerce through brand sites and\nstores linked to our wholesale brands. Retail refers to business through\nour own retail network (stores, franchisees and eCommerce through\nretail sites). The type of customer to which sales are made determines\nwhether the customer is allocated to Wholesale or Retail. The integrated\nmargin within the retail segment is shown for Van de Velde products sold\nthrough Van de Velde\u2018s own retail network. In other words, the retail\nsegment comprises the wholesale margin on Van de Velde products\nand the results generated within the network itself.\nManagement monitors the results in the two segments to a certain level\n(\u2018direct contribution\u2019) separately, so that decisions can be made on the\nallocation of resources and the evaluation of performance.

   "value": "\n30. Business risks with respect to IFRS7\n \nBesides the general strategic risks, Van de Velde has identified the fol-\nlowing risks with respect to IFRS 7:\nCurrency risk\nDue to its international character, the Group is confronted with various\nexchange rate risks on sale and purchase transactions.\nIn terms of currency risk, between 25% and 30% of Group turnover is\ngenerated in currencies other than the euro. In addition, a significant\nproportion of purchases and expenses are in foreign currency (e.g. pur-\nchases of raw materials and subcontractors, as well as local expenses\nwithin the retail network).\nWhere possible, currency risks are managed by offsetting transactions in\nthe same currency or by fixing exchange rates through forward contracts.\nThese risks are managed at the level of the parent company. The Group\nis aware that exchange risks cannot always be fully hedged.\nForeign operations increase the currency risk of the Group. Financial\ninstruments are not used to hedge this risk.\nClosing rate Average rate\nCAD 1.4466 1.4804\nCHF 1.0368 1.0795\nAUD 1.5575 1.5758\nNOK 0.8394 0.8577\nGBP 1.1295 1.1810\nUSD 3.2518 3.2818\nThe Group performed a sensitivity analysis in 2021 on the outstanding\ntrade receivables and trade payables of the Group at the balance sheet\ndate have been converted with a sensitivity of 10%.\n000\ue61feuro +10% -10%\nCAD 62 -62\nCHF 81 -81\nAUD 30 -30\nGBP 66 -66\n239 -239\nThe Group performed a sensitivity analysis in 2021 on the the equity\ncomponents in the foreign currency of the Group at the balance sheet\ndate have been converted with a sensitivity of 10%.\n000 euro +10% -10%\nGBP 353 -353\nUSD 1,363 -1,363\nTND 1,238 -1,238\n2,954 -2,954\nCredit risk\nAs a consequence of the large diversified customer portfolio, the Group\ndoes not have a significant concentration of credit risks. The Group has\ndeveloped strategies and additional procedures to monitor and limit\ncredit risk at its customers. Wholesale sales are generated through\naround 3,600 independent retailers and a small number of luxury depart-\nment stores. No single customer accounts for more than 2.2% of the\nannual turnover of the Group.\nFurthermore, the insolvency risk is covered by credit insurance. In\naccordance with IFRS9, the Group applies the ECL model to its trade\nreceivables. For further explanation in this regard, we refer to note 10.\nWith respect to eCommerce activities, the credit risk is limited by using\ncountry-specific payment methods, and there is collaboration with an\nexternal partner who monitors the creditworthiness of potential eCom-\nmerce customers.\n\nLiquidity and cash flow risk\nThe liquidity and cash flow risk is rather limited thanks to the large\noperational cash flow and the net cash position (73.5 million euro). Credit\nlines worth more than 10 million euro are also available. The Group has\nno borrowings with fixed repayments.\nRisk of interruptions in the supply chain\nAdequate measures have been taken in several areas to minimize inter-\nruptions in the supply chain and deal with any such interruptions that do\noccur. Examples of such measures are:\n \u2013\nThe IT department has a disaster recovery plan designed to minimize\nthe risk of damage from the failure of the computer infrastructure.\nInvestments are also made to limit the risk of failure of the computer\ninfrastructure.\n \u2013 The risks of interruption in deliveries by a supplier and the possible \nalternatives (if available) have been identified and are regularly moni-\ntored. The creditworthiness of suppliers is also monitored.\n \u2013 As far as possible, the concentration risk at suppliers is managed by \nsufficient diversification. The ten leading material suppliers account\nfor approximately 60% of purchase costs of material. The largest\nsupplier accounts for approximately 26% of purchase costs and the\nsecond largest supplier for 9% , whereas all other suppliers account\nfor maximum 5%.\n \u2013\nAssembly capacity is mainly spread over Tunisia, China and Thailand.\n \u2013\nThe raw materials warehouse and the distribution centre are located\nat the same site. These warehouses are in separate buildings and\nboth comply with high safety standards.\n \u2013 Transparent chain management has been set up in which provisions \nand/or any interruptions are proactively identified so that action can\nbe taken.\n \nMoreover, business risks as a consequence of a potential interruption\nare covered by insurance. Adequate measures have been taken in con-\nsultation with insurers who also regularly inspect the various locations.\nRisk of overvalued stock\nVan de Velde\u2019s business model entails risks with regard to raw materi-\nals and finished products. Raw materials are ordered and production is\nlaunched before we have full insight into the orders. As far as possible,\nVan de Velde attempts to concentrate this risk at the level of raw materi-\nals rather than finished products.\nVan de Velde also applies a strict policy regarding write-downs on\ninventories:\n \u2013 The value of finished products for which sales are declining is writ-\nten down at the end of the season or during the following season.\nThese finished products are fully written off in the subsequent year.\n \u2013 If there is no further need for additional production, the related raw \nmaterials are written off completely.\n \nProduct risk\nSales are spread over about 50,000 stock references, more than 10,000\nof which are changed every season. Therefore, sales do not depend on\nthe success of any one model.\nCompliance and regulatory risks\nVan de Velde Group is subject to federal, regional and local laws and regu\n-\nlations in each country in which it operates. Such laws and regulations\nrelate to a wide variety of matters, such as data security, privacy, product\nliability, health and safety, import and export, occupational accidents,\nemployment practices and the relationship with associates (regarding\novertime and workplace safety among other things), tax matters, unfair\ncompetitive practices and similar regulations.\nCompliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenues\nand profitability of the Group and could affect its business, financial\nconditions or the results of operations.\nVan de Velde Group has been subject to and may in the future be subject\nto allegations of violating certain laws and/or regulations. Such allega-\ntions or investigations or proceedings may require the Group to devote\nsignificant management resources to defending itself. In the event that\nsuch allegations are proven, Van de Velde may be subject to significant\nfines, damages awards and other expenses, and its reputation may be\nharmed.\nVan de Velde Group actively strives to ensure compliance with all laws\nand regulations to which it is subject. A degree of insurance has been\ntaken out to cover some of the above-mentioned risks.\nOther operational risks\nThe Group is also faced with other operational risks which (if possible)\nare monitored and for which (if available) correcting actions are taken.\n",
